Restaurant order api excercise
=========================

How to run the code:
The code was developed and is currently running on a glitch instance with the auto-generated name `kind-attack` at the following url:

[kind-attack](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/kind-attack)

Alternatively, the code can be downloaded using glitch's [advanced options](https://glitch.com/faq#github).

If done in this way, dependencies should be instaled first:

    $ yarn install && yarn start

Enviromental variables should be provided for the google maps api and rabbitMQ, for example:

    GMAPS_DM_API_KEY=abc123
    AMQP_URL=amqp://xxx:yyy@example.com
    
And you should be good to go.
